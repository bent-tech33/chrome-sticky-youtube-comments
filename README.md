# chrome-sticky-youtube-comments
Stick youtube comments so you can read them while watching videos.

Just zip the contents and install as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
You can make the comments always sticky from the extensions's settings dialog box.

Known Bug:
- when using full screen, videos chapters are misaligned.
